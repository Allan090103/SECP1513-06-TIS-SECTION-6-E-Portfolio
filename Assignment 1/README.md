# Reflection on Assignment 1 â€“ Report on Visit to NALI 2023
There are lots of things that I have learned when I went to the NALI 2023 
event. I get to learn about some of the innovative ideas on teaching and 
learning method that the participants have presented during the event. I get to 
understand in depth about certain software used to develop certain 
applications. At the same time, I also meet some UTM researchers and my 
course seniors. Thru this event I get to make some new friends. I also get to 
interview some of the participants regarding their innovative ideas on teaching 
and learning method. This activity helped to boost my confidence level up. 
Improvement that can be made on the event is, for the next NALI event they 
should organize during the weekend so that more students can come and join,
since during the weekdays some of the students are busy with their classes. 
Overall, the event was fun and exciting and at same time I learnt lots of things 
that are related to the TIS course such as hardware, software and information 
systems.
