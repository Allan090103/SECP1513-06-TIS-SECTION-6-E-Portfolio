# Reflection on Assignment 2 â€“ Poster on Industrial Talk 1
On 14 of November we attended an industrial talk from Clarity Techworks Sdn. 
Bhd . During the talk we got a little overview on the types of jobs that are 
available in the IT department. We also got to learn about the job scopes , 
requirements and the discipline practices . The talk is very beneficial as it 
prepares us for future job applications. In the talk we were also given advice on 
ways to handle our university life and improve our skill sets. Improvement that 
could have been made is, the event could have been a little longer since there 
were lots of questions from the students that could not be covered due the 
time limit. While doing the poster we also get to learn to use the Canva 
application to create creative designs for our poster. Overall, the activity was 
interesting and at same time it was beneficial as it shows a little insight into the 
future of worklife.
