# Reflection on the Design Thinking Project Report
The Design Thinking Project was super beneficial as it puts a test on my critical thinking abilities.
From the Design Thinking Project we are able to learn a lot of things such as identifying a certain problem and creating a possible solution for the problem.
We conducted some research regarding a certain problem and brainstrom some idea to solve the problem. The most exciting part of this Design Thinking Project is the 
process of creating a prototype that is able to solve the certain problem. It was fun as we learn to use various plaforms and softwares to create our prototype.
Challenges that we faced when doing the report was that we are unable to conduct face to face meetings within us as all of the group members are busy preparing for their finals during the study week. Overall it was a fun experience to do the Design Thinking Project.
