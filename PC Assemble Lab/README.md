# Reflection on the PC Assemble Lab 
The PC Assemble Lab was fun and exciting at the same time. It was the first time I had experience with PC during the lab.
The lab assistants there were super friendly and helpful. They guide us step by step on the ways to disassemble and reassemble the PC.
During the lab I was introduced to different parts of the PC and the functions of each parts.
The lab was supper beneficial as it gives a little introduction to PC building experience.

Here is a simple video for you to refer on how to assemble a PC :
